# Fitzone-Gym-management-System

Project Description

FitZone – Fitness Center Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage the daily operations of a gym or fitness center in a structured and efficient way. The system replaces manual record-keeping with a centralized digital platform for managing members, trainers, subscriptions, and class schedules.

The application follows a role-based authentication system with separate access for Admin, Trainer, and Member. Admins can manage users, trainers, subscription plans, and class schedules, while members can view available classes, manage their memberships, and track their fitness-related activities.

The frontend is built using React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a fast, responsive, and modern user interface. The backend is developed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, using JWT-based authentication for secure login and authorization.

This project addresses real-world gym management challenges such as member data handling, trainer scheduling, class booking, and subscription tracking. It serves as a strong foundation for a production-ready system and can be easily extended with additional features like online payments, attendance tracking, and analytics.
